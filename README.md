`llmware` is a unified framework for developing LLM-based application patterns including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This project provides an integrated set of tools that anyone can use ‚Äì from beginner to the most sophisticated AI developer ‚Äì to rapidly build industrial-grade, knowledge-based enterprise LLM applications with specific focus on making it easy to integrate open source small specialized models and connecting enterprise knowledge safely and securely to LLMs in private cloud.

## üå± Getting Started

### 1. Install llmware:

```bash
pip install llmware
```
or 
```bash
python3 -m pip install llmware
```
See [Working with llmware](#%EF%B8%8F-working-with-the-llmware-github-repository) for other options to get up and running.

### 2. MongoDB and Milvus

MongoDB and Milvus are optional and used to provide production-grade database and vector embedding capabilities. The fastest way to get started is to use the provided Docker Compose file (note: requires Docker Compose / Docker desktop to be installed) which takes care of running them both:
```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llmware-ai/llmware/main/docker-compose.yaml
```
and then run the containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Not ready to install MongoDB or Milvus?  Check out what you can do without them in our [examples section](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/blob/main/examples/README.md#using-llmware-without-mongodb-or-an-embedding-database).

See [Running MongoDB and Milvus](#%EF%B8%8F-alternate-options-for-running-mongodb-and-milvus) for other options to get up and running with these optional dependencies.

### 3. üî• Start coding - Quick Start for RAG üî• 
```python
# This example illustrates a simple contract analysis
# using a small RAG-optimized LLM running locally

import os
import re
from llmware.prompts import Prompt, HumanInTheLoop
from llmware.setup import Setup
from llmware.configs import LLMWareConfig

def contract_analysis_on_laptop (model_name):

    # Load the llmware sample files
    print (f"\n > Loading the llmware sample files...")
    sample_files_path = Setup().load_sample_files()
    contracts_path = os.path.join(sample_files_path,"Agreements")
 
    # query list
    query_list = {"executive employment agreement": "What are the name of the two parties?",
                  "base salary": "What is the executive's base salary?",
                  "governing law": "What is the governing law?"}

    print (f"\n > Loading model {model_name}...")

    prompter = Prompt().load_model(model_name)

    for i, contract in enumerate(os.listdir(contracts_path)):

        #   excluding Mac file artifact
        if contract != ".DS_Store":

            print("\nAnalyzing contract: ", str(i+1), contract)

            print("LLM Responses:")
            for key, value in query_list.items():

                # contract is parsed, text-chunked, and then filtered by topic key
                source = prompter.add_source_document(contracts_path, contract, query=key)

                # calling the LLM with 'source' information from the contract automatically packaged into the prompt
                responses = prompter.prompt_with_source(value, prompt_name="just_the_facts", temperature=0.3)

                for r, response in enumerate(responses):
                    print(key, ":", re.sub("[\n]"," ", response["llm_response"]).strip())

                # We're done with this contract, clear the source from the prompt
                prompter.clear_source_materials()

    # Save jsonl report to jsonl to /prompt_history folder
    print("\nPrompt state saved at: ", os.path.join(LLMWareConfig.get_prompt_path(),prompter.prompt_id))
    prompter.save_state()

    # Save csv report that includes the model, response, prompt, and evidence for human-in-the-loop review
    csv_output = HumanInTheLoop(prompter).export_current_interaction_to_csv()
    print("csv output saved at:  ", csv_output)


if __name__ == "__main__":

    # use local cpu model - smallest, fastest (use larger BLING models for higher accuracy)
    model = "llmware/bling-1b-0.1"

    contract_analysis_on_laptop(model)

```

#### üìö See 50+ [llmware examples](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/blob/main/examples/README.md) for more RAG examples and other code samples and ideas.


### 4. Accessing LLMs and setting-up API keys & secrets

To use LLMWare, you do not need to use any proprietary LLM - we would encourage you to experiment with [BLING](https://huggingface.co/llmware), [DRAGON](https://huggingface.co/llmware), [Industry-BERT](https://huggingface.co/llmware), the GGUF examples, along with bringing in your favorite models from HuggingFace and Sentence Transformers. 

If you would like to use a proprietary model, you will need to provide your own API Keys.   API keys and secrets for models, aws, and pinecone can be set-up for use in environment variables or passed directly to method calls. 

## üîπ Alternate options for running MongoDB and Milvus

There are several options for getting MongoDB running
<details>
<summary><b>üê≥  A. Run mongo container with docker </b></summary>
  
  ```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017  -v mongodb-volume:/data/db --name=mongodb mongo:latest
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üê≥  B. Run container with docker compose </b></summary>
  
 Create a _docker-compose.yaml_ file with the content: 
```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  mongodb:
    container_name: mongodb
    image: 'mongo:latest'
    volumes:
      - mongodb-volume:/data/db
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'

volumes:
    llmware-mongodb:
      driver: local
```
and then run:
```bash
docker compose up
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üìñ  C. Install MongoDB natively </b></summary>
  
See the [Official MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üîó  D. Connect to an existing MongoDB deployment </b></summary>
  
You can connect to an existing MongoDB deployment by setting the connection string to the environment variable, ```COLLECTION_DB_URI```.  See the example script, [Using Mongo Atlas](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/blob/main/examples/using_mongo_atlas.py), for detailed information on how to use Mongo Atlas as the NoSQL and/or Vector Database for `llmware`.  

Additional information on finding and formatting connection strings can be found in the [MongoDB Connection Strings Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).


</details>

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working with the llmware Github repository

The llmware repo can be pulled locally to get access to all the examples, or to work directly with the latest version of the llmware code.

### Pull the repo locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:llmware-ai/llmware.git
```
or download/extract a [zip of the llmware repository](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

### Run llmware natively 

Update the local copy of the repository:

```bash
git pull
```
Download the shared llmware native libraries and dependencies by running the load_native_libraries.sh script. This pulls the right wheel for your platform and extracts the llmware native libraries and dependencies into the proper place in the local repository.   
 
```bash
./scripts/dev/load_native_libraries.sh
```

At the top level of the llmware repository run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```
